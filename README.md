#PythonMarkov: 
##A Markov Chain Generator in Python

Run ```python markov.py``` to run a text sample (uses Declaration of Independence and 4chan data)

Run ```python im_mark.py``` with some images (```.jpg```) in the same folder to do some image prediction. More pics = better, generally. 

There are a few hidden 'test' functions in ```im_mark.py```, which just do stuff like inverting the image.
